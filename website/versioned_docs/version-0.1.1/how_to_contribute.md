Thank you for taking your time to consider contributing to Kunyora or its view bindings. Kunyora is one of the few open source projects tailored to address the problems of speed at the long run, which makes it a very interesting project you might want to invest your time with as an open source contributor. If you are interested in contributing to Kunyora, hopefully this documentation would make the process for contributing clearer.

## Code of Conduct

Kunyora has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text article](https://github.com/kunyora/react-kunyora/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contriute to kunyora and the client libraries such as react-kunyora, many of which might not involve you writing any code. Here is a few ideas on getting started:

* Simply start using kunyora. Go through the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guide. Does everything work as expected? if no and its kunyora specific, then submit an [issue here](https://github.com/kunyora/kunyora/issues) else if the issue is with react-kunyora, then submit an [issue here](https://github.com/kunyora/react-kunyora/issues)

* Read through the [Kunyora Docs](https://kunyora.github.io/kunyora). If you find anything that seems confusing or unclear, then you can make edits by clicking `Edits` at the top of the page.

* Take a look at the [requested features](todos.md) by the community and try opening a pull request if there are any that you can solve.

## How we make releases

Kunyora currently uses semantic versioning, which allows us to structure the library in a more predictable way needed for our users to understand release versions better. Also we would try as much as possible to keep the master branch as stable as possible with tests passing. Also we believe in testing bugs fixes and new features thoroughly before merging to master. All new features for kunyora should be made public by opening a [pull request here](https://github.com/kunyora/kunyora/pulls) and those of react-kunyora should be made public by opening a [pull request here](https://github.com/kunyora/react-kunyora/pulls)

## Styling

The library uses the [Airbnb Javascript](<(https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md)>) and [ReactJs](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/react/README.md) style guides

## Making Pull Requests

For now, making a pull requests is quite flexible since the library is just growing. However, we would adopt better patterns in making pull requests in future versions. However, you should make a very detailed description of what you changed or the new feature you are proposing.

## License

By contributing to Kunyora, you agree that your contrinutions will be licensed under the MIT license.
