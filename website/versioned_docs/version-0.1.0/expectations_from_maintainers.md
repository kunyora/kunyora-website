Thanks for taking your time into considering being a maintainer. For now, we would keep this section as flexible and as simple as possible. However, as a maintainer, you should make sure that every pull requests you make is quite detailed and explanatory. Also endeavour to check if a problem or an issue is being addressed before attempting to solve it by checking through the pull requests opened on github for that issue.

For now, we would stick to the above information and make it more project specific as times goes on. So feel free to [open a pull requests](https://github.com/kunyora/kunyora/pulls).
