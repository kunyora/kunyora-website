This page will help you get started with installing and setting up the Kunyora environment on your personal or work computer. If you have already done this, then you can skip ahead to the [Quick tutorial section](quick_tutorial.html).

To get started with this library, you need to set up [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-strted.html).You can use npm or yarn to install the library.

To do this, cd into the project directory and enter the following commands

```powershell
  #For use in a Javasript non-native linked environment

  npm install --save kunyora
  # or with yarn
  yarn add kunyora
```

However, if you are using a view library like ReactJs, then you can cd into the reactJs project directory and yarn add or npm install react-kunyora. This would automatically install the latest version of kunyora too.

```powershell
  #For use with reactJs

  npm install --save react-kunyora
  #or with yarn
  yarn add react-kunyora
```

# What's Next?

Congratulations, you have successfully installed kunyora. What follows are getting acquinted with the rudiments of the library. If you are curious to learn more about the library then check this out the [Quick tutorial section](quick_tutorial.md)
