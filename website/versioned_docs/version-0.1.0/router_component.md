The Router component is one which helps in initializing a request handshake between 2 pages or screens. It is a low level api built using the common `render props` reactJs pattern. This low level component does not work on mobile i.e `react-native` or any other Javascript based mobile native library except hybrid based i.e `Cordova`. This component is quite useful when you are building a web app that requires a `screen` to download some contents before pushing the user to the next route. The `Router`component is conceptually used in this scenario to instantiate the download before the Push.

Also, the push can be implemented irrespective of the routing library being used. with the `Router` component, one could specify that screens should download both the `Component` and fetch the `queries` which would be displayed on the next screen before actually performing the route.
Therefore, in this tutorial, we would be building a very small application which would show the `Router` component in action. Let's swing into action to se how this is done.

* [`Setting up the routes`](router_component.md#setting-up-the-routes)
* [`Prefetching Data`](router_component.md#prefetching-data)
* [`Rendering Data`](router_component.md#rendering-data)

## Building a simple page navigator

In this section, we would be building a very simple page navigator. Our page navigator would consist of 2 screens. The first containing a button which when clicked routes a user to the next screen containing a list of **prefetched** notifications. In this tutorial, we would be using `react-router v4` as our routing library. So Let's go ahead to set up our application from scratch.

## Setting up the routes

In this section, we would be setting up the routes for our navigator based application. As stated earlier, we would be making use of `react-router v4` as our routing library. We would assume that you are quite familiar with `react-router` and therefore skip all the details in explaining the library itself. Please refer to the [react-router](reactRouter.com) site if you are not familiar with using the library.

```javascript
/**
 * Index.js
 */
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import KunyoraClient from "kunyora";
import { KunyoraProvider } from "react-kunyora";
import registerServiceWorker from "./registerServiceWorker";

import AppRoutes from "./AppRoutes";

const client = KunyoraClient({
  baseURL: "https://kunyora.herokuapp.com/",
  nouns: [{ path: "notification", name: "notification" }]
});

const App = props => (
  <KunyoraProvider client={client} store={client.store}>
    <AppRoutes />
  </KunyoraProvider>
);

render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
registerServiceWorker();
```

In the code above, we set up the client of the application using the `KunyoraProvider` top level component and `KunyoraClient`, please refer to the [KunyoraProvider Docs](kunyora_provider_component.md) to learn about this component and the [`Kunyora Docs`](kunyora_tutorial.md) for more reference.

```javascript
/**
 *  AppRoutes.js
 */

import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

import Initiator from "./Initiator";
import Notification from "./Notification";

const AppRoutes = props => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/" component={Initiator} exact />
      <Route path="/notification" component={Notification} exact />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
);

export default AppRoutes;
```

In the code above, we setup our routes.

## Prefetching Data

Let's create the `Initiator` screen of our application. This screen would be used in initializing the request using the `Router` component.

```javascript
/**
 * Initiator.js
 */
import React from "react";
import { Router } from "react-kunyora";

const Initiator = props => (
  <Router
    name="Notification"
    loader={() => import("./Notification")}
    resources={[{ operation: "getNotification" }]}
    onRequestRoute={() => props.history.push("/notification")}
  >
    {(routeState, fetchProgress, push) => (
      <button onClick={() => push()}>View Notifications</button>
    )}
  </Router>
);

export default Initiator;
```

In the above, we supply a name for our route which is required. If you are code splitting from the route level, then make sure that the `Connector` and the `Router` both have the same name. The `loader` prop is used to prefetch that route before initial route, the `resource` prop is used to specify a list of queries to prefetch before routing the user to the next screen. The `onRequestRoute` prop should be used to specify a function which would be called when the contents have been downloaded. In our case, we use `react-router` to oute the user to the next screen.

The parameter specified in the children props of the `Router` component should be used within it to carry out its functionalities. In this case, we pass the `push` parameter to the buttons `onClick` event.

## Rendering Data

Here, we would create the `Notification` component which would be used in displaying the notification. We would not go into details in explaining the `Query` component, we assume that you are familiar with it, however you can check up the [Query Tutorial](query_component.md) for more reference.

```javascript
/**
 * Notification.js
 */
import React from "react";
import { Query } from "react-kunyora";

const Notification = props => (
  <Query operation="getNotification">
    {notifications => {
      let component =
        notifications.data !== undefined ? (
          <ul>
            {notifications.data.map((notification, i) => (
              <li key={i}>{notification.name}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        ) : null;
      return component;
    }}
  </Query>
);

export default Notification;
```

Ideally, we are suppose to code split at the route level within the `Notification` component using the `Connector` component. However, you can check up our series of tutorials for an example of how to achieve this purpose.

Run your application and see the beauty in using the `react-kunyora`. Please check out the [Router Api reference](router_component_api_overview.md) for an overview of ythe component.
