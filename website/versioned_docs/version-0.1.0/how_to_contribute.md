## How we make releases

Kunyora currently uses semantic versioning, which allows us to structure the library in a more predictable more needed for our users to understand release versions better. Also we would try as much as possible to keep the master branch as stable as possible with tests passing. Also we believe in testing bugs fixes and new features throughly before merging to master.

## Styling

The library uses the Airbnb Javascript and ReactJs style guides
