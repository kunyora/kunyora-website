We are excited to introduce `Kunyora` which would help manage restful api request made by our apps. `Kunyora` is a rest based client for Javascript applications built to solve the problem of speed on the long run. Kunyora would automatically be responsible for decoding sequences on the client side.

Kunyora is currently in its first phase, which would allow it to grow very rapidly. The library also has integrations with ReactJs and should provide support for other view libraries such as AngularJs and VueJs soon.

Please check out our [vision](/kunyora/docs/vision.html) for a brief on why we built Kunyora.
